# Essential Questions

# 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with actively engaging with stakeholders to understand their goals, preferences, and challenges. This understanding is translated into user stories, which provide a concise and actionable format for development. By structuring user stories around the “who,” “what,” and “why,” they clarify the desired functionality and business value. For example, a user story like “As a user, I want personalized travel recommendations based on my preferences so I can plan vacations more efficiently” ensures that the development aligns with user expectations. User stories also provide clear acceptance criteria, enabling developers to measure success and maintain focus on delivering value.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is rooted in iterative and incremental improvement, following Agile principles. I believe that breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks and prioritizing features that offer immediate value leads to a more efficient development process. Agile processes such as Scrum events, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, and Sprint Reviews, provide structure and transparency, keeping the team aligned on shared goals. Backlog refinement ensures that tasks are consistently reviewed and reprioritized as project requirements evolve. Additionally, Sprint Retrospectives help identify what worked well and what needs improvement, driving continuous process enhancement. By incorporating these Agile practices into my future work, I aim to create adaptive, resilient development processes that deliver high-quality, user-centered software solutions.

# 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means fostering open communication, collaboration, accountability, and adaptability. Good team members actively participate in discussions, share updates, and address concerns to maintain transparency and project momentum. They support one another by sharing knowledge and assisting teammates when challenges arise. Taking ownership of assigned tasks and delivering them on time with high quality reflects a strong sense of accountability. Adaptability is also crucial, as project requirements often change, requiring team members to adjust their focus and responsibilities quickly. Ultimately, good team members build trust and mutual respect, contributing to a positive, productive team environment that supports shared success in achieving project goals.
